# Code Lab Spring 2021

Tuesdays 10:00amâ€“11:00am EST | [Zoom](https://risd.zoom.us/j/299845160)

Code Lab provides foundational skills training for folks interested in computation basics. This wonâ€™t be for credit, it wonâ€™t assign projects, and it wonâ€™t require any commitment other than showing up. Itâ€™s about providing supplemntal technical instruction and support that you can incorporate into your class projects.

The lab section will be about 60 minutes and will meet every Tuesday over the course of this semester. Each meeting will consist of introducing a technical concept by demoing an example use case.
